# MATLAB Scripts for Electronic Feedback Control

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts designed for the analysis, design, and simulation of electronic feedback control systems. These scripts are intended to assist students, educators, and professionals in the field of control engineering or anyone interested in understanding and implementing feedback control mechanisms using MATLAB.

## Repository Contents

- **Basic Control Systems**: Scripts demonstrating fundamental concepts of feedback control such as PID controllers, lead-lag compensators, etc.
- **System Analysis Tools**: Tools for analyzing the stability, responsiveness, and robustness of control systems.
- **Simulation Models**: MATLAB models simulating various control system dynamics and responses.
- **Advanced Control Techniques**: Scripts implementing advanced control strategies like adaptive control, nonlinear control, etc.
- **Utility Functions**: A set of utility functions to aid in common tasks like plotting response curves, system identification, etc.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB (Preferably the latest version)
- Control System Toolbox for MATLAB
- Basic understanding of control theory and MATLAB scripting

## Installation

Clone this repository or download the source files into your MATLAB working directory. Ensure that you have the required MATLAB toolboxes installed.

## Usage

Navigate to the script of interest and open it using MATLAB. Each script is well-commented to explain the underlying theory and implementation steps. You can run the scripts as-is to see a demonstration or modify them for your specific use case.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a MATLAB script that you believe would be a valuable addition, please feel free to open a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
